Project Description/Outline
* We plan to grab covid data from two different sources. The first source is a CSV file from Kaggle
* (https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress).
* The second source is JSON data from https://covidtracking.com/data/national. 
* We will clean the CSV file to only include data from the USA. Then we will load JSON data that
* corresponds to the date ranges in the the CSV. Data cleanup will be handled with with Pandas. 
* We will finish by loading this data into Postgres.
